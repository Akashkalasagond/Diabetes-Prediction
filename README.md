# Diabetes Prediction using MLP (Artificial Neural Network)

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant health features. The prediction model is built using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to contribute to early diagnosis and proactive management of diabetes.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset used in this project has been carefully preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure data quality.

- **Model Architecture:** The heart of the project lies in the design and implementation of the MLP. The neural network architecture has been fine-tuned to achieve optimal predictive performance.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Sciket-Learn
- Jupyter Notebooks 

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-mlp.git
    cd diabetes-prediction-mlp
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Model:**
